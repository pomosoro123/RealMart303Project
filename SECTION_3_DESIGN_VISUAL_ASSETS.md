## YOUR THREE MAIN DELIVERABLES

### Deliverable 1: Website Mockups/Wireframes
### Deliverable 2: Color Scheme & Branding Guide
### Deliverable 3: Images & Icon Assets

---

# DELIVERABLE 1: WEBSITE MOCKUPS/WIREFRAMES

## What Are Mockups?
Simple visual sketches showing where content, buttons, and images go on each page. Think of them as blueprints for the website.

## Tools You Can Use (All FREE):
- **Figma** (go to figma.com - very popular, easy to use)
- **Canva** (canva.com - drag and drop designer)
- **Penpot** (penpot.app - free design tool)
- **Adobe XD** (xd.adobe.com - free trial)
- **Hand-drawn sketches** - Take clear photos, works too!

## The 4 Pages to Design

### Page 1: HOME PAGE
**Purpose:** Welcome users and help them get started

**Show in your mockup:**
- Logo/header at the top
- Welcome message
- Search bar (prominent and easy to see)
- Featured markets section (showing 3-5 markets)
- Navigation menu (links to other pages)
- Footer with contact info
- Call-to-action button ("View All Markets", "Search Now")

**Keep in mind:**
- Should look welcoming and clean
- Search bar should be very visible
- Images should show markets/shopping
- Mobile-friendly (also design for phone view)

**Example wireframe:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      LOGO + MENU        │
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Welcome to Markets   │
│ [   Search Bar    ]     │
├─────────────────────────┤
