## IMPORTANT: MARKET NAME MATCHING

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Market names in THIS spreadsheet must match Section 1 EXACTLY!

**If Section 1 says:** "Central Farmers Market"  
**Your spreadsheet should say:** "Central Farmers Market" (not "Central Market" or "Farmers Market")

This is important because developers will use the market names to link the data together. Mismatches will break the website!
